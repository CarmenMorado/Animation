# Animation
100 Days of Swift (Project 15) A technique project that introduces one of the most important techniques in iOS development: animation. Throughout the course of
this project, I learned about animate(withDuration:), CGAffineTransform, alpha, and more.

In addition, I completed the following challenges:
-Go back to project 8 and make the letter group buttons fade out when they are tapped. We were using the isHidden property, but you'll need to switch to alpha 
because isHidden is either true or false, it has no animatable values between.
-Go back to project 13 and make the image view fade in when a new picture is chosen. To make this work, set the alpha to 0 first.
-Go back to project 2 and make the flags scale down with a little bounce when pressed.
